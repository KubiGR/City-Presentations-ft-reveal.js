          <h4>An Introduction to JavaScript</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.</li>
            <li>
              The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be
              written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the
              page loads.
            </li>
            <li>
              Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need
              special preparation or compilation to run.
            </li>
            <li>
              When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name:
              “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was
              decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of
              Java would help. But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully
              independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript,
              and now it has no relation to Java at all.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>JavaScript engine</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on
              the server, or actually on any device that has a special program
              called the JavaScript engine.
            </li>
            <li>
              The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript
              virtual machine”.
            </li>
            <li>
              Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:
              <ul>
                <li>V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.</li>
                <li>SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.</li>
                <li>
                  …There are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE,
                  “JavaScriptCore”, “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>What can in-browser JavaScript do?</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not
              provide low-level access to memory or CPU, because it was
              initially created for browsers which do not require it.
            </li>
            <li>
              JavaScript’s capabilities greatly depend on the environment it’s
              running in. For instance, Node.js supports functions that allow
              JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network
              requests, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage
              manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.
            </li>
            <li>
              For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify
                  styles.
                </li>
                <li>
                  React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements,
                  key presses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and
                  upload files (so-called AJAX and COMET technologies).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show
                  messages.
                </li>
                <li>Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>What CAN’T in-browser JavaScript do?</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              JavaScript’s abilities in the browser are limited for the sake of
              a user’s safety. The aim is to prevent an evil webpage from
              accessing private information or harming the user’s data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Examples of such restrictions include:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  JavaScript on a webpage may not read/write arbitrary files on
                  the hard disk, copy them or execute programs. It has no direct
                  access to OS functions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Modern browsers allow it to work with files, but the access is
                  limited and only provided if the user does certain actions,
                  like “dropping” a file into a browser window or selecting it
                  via an &lt;input&gt; tag.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are ways to interact with camera/microphone and other
                  devices, but they require a user’s explicit permission. So a
                  JavaScript-enabled page may not sneakily enable a web-camera,
                  observe the surroundings and send the information to the NSA.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Different tabs/windows generally do not know about each other.
                  Sometimes they do, for example when one window uses JavaScript
                  to open the other one. But even in this case, JavaScript from
                  one page may not access the other if they come from different
                  sites (from a different domain, protocol or port).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>What CAN’T in-browser JavaScript do?</h4>
          <hr />

          <ul>
            <li>
              JavaScript can easily communicate over the net to the server where
              the current page came from. But its ability to receive data from
              other sites/domains is crippled. Though possible, it requires
              explicit agreement (expressed in HTTP headers) from the remote
              side. Once again, that’s a safety limitation.
            </li>

            <li>
              Such limits do not exist if JavaScript is used outside of the
              browser, for example on a server. Modern browsers also allow
              plugin/extensions which may ask for extended permissions.
            </li>

          <hr />
          <p>
            Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements
            can be separated with a semicolon.
          </p>
          <pre><code data-trim>
            alert('Hello'); alert('World');

            alert('Hello');

          <h4>
            In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases”
            does not mean “always”! It is recommended to put semicolons between
            statements even if they are separated by newlines.

          <h4>"use strict"</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              For a long time, JavaScript evolved without compatibility issues.
              New features were added to the language while old functionality
              didn’t change.
            </li>
            <li>
              That had the benefit of never breaking existing code. But the
              downside was that any mistake or an imperfect decision made by
              JavaScript’s creators got stuck in the language forever.
            </li>
            <li>
              This was the case until 2009 when ECMAScript 5 (ES5) appeared. It
              added new features to the language and modified some of the
              existing ones. To keep the old code working, most such
              modifications are off by default. You need to explicitly enable
              them with a special directive: "use strict".
            </li>
          </ul>
          <pre><code data-trim>
            "use strict";

            // this code works the modern way
            ...
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            <em
              >Modern JavaScript supports “classes” and “modules” – advanced
              language structures (we’ll surely get to them), that enable use
              strict automatically. So we don’t need to add the "use strict"
              directive, if we use them.

          <h4>Variables</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword.</p>
          <pre><code data-trim>
            let message;

            message = 'Hello'; // store the string 'Hello' in the variable named message
          </code></pre>
          <pre><code data-trim>
            let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';

            let user = 'John';
            let age = 25;
            let message = 'Hello';

            let user = 'John'
              , age = 25
              , message = 'Hello';
          </code></pre>
          <pre><code data-trim>
            let hello = 'Hello world!';
            let message;
            message = hello;

            // now two variables hold the same data
            alert(hello); // Hello world!
            alert(message); // Hello world!
          </code></pre>
          <pre><code data-trim>
            let message = "This";
            let message = "That"; // SyntaxError: 'message' has already been declared
          </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Variable naming</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>There are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and
              _.
            </li>
            <li>The first character must not be a digit.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            When the name contains multiple words, camelCase is commonly used.
            That is: words go one after another, each word except first starting
            with a capital letter: <code>myVeryLongName</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Variables named <code>apple</code> and <code>AppLE</code> are two
            different variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a list of reserved words, which cannot be used as variable
            names because they are used by the language itself. For example:
            let, class, return, and function are reserved.
          </p>
          <pre><code data-trim>
              let let = 5; // can't name a variable "let", error!
              let return = 5; // also can't name it "return", error!
            </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Constants</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use const instead of
            let:
          </p>
          <pre><code data-trim>
            const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';

            myBirthday = '01.01.2001'; // error, can't reassign the constant!
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            There is a widespread practice to use constants as aliases for
            difficult-to-remember values that are known prior to execution. Such
            constants are named using capital letters and underscores.
          </p>
          <pre><code data-trim>
            const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
            const COLOR_GREEN = "#0F0";
            const COLOR_BLUE = "#00F";
            const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";
            
            // ...when we need to pick a color
            let color = COLOR_ORANGE;
            alert(color); // #FF7F00
          </code></pre>
          <pre><code data-trim>
            const pageLoadTime = /* time taken by a webpage to load */;
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            The value of pageLoadTime is not known prior to the page load, so
            it’s named normally. But it’s still a constant because it doesn’t
            change after assignment. In other words, capital-named constants are
            only used as aliases for “hard-coded” values.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Data types</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript,
            are called “dynamically typed”, meaning that there exist data types,
            but variables are not bound to any of them.
          </p>
          <pre><code data-trim>
            // no error
            let message = "hello";
            message = 123456;
          </code></pre>

          <ul style="float: left">
            <li>Number</li>
            <li>BigInt</li>
            <li>String</li>

            <dt>operand</dt>
            <dd>
              is what operators are applied to. For instance, in the
              multiplication of 5 * 2 there are two operands: the left operand
              is 5 and the right operand is 2. Sometimes, people call these
              “arguments” instead of “operands”.
            </dd>
            <dt>unary</dt>
            <dd>
              An operator is unary if it has a single operand. For example, the
              unary negation - reverses the sign of a number
              <pre><code data-trim>
                let x = 1;
                x = -x;

            </dd>
            <dt>binary</dt>
            <dd>
              An operator is binary if it has two operands. The same minus
              exists in binary form as well
              <pre><code data-trim>
                let x = 1, y = 3;
                alert( y - x ); // 2, binary minus subtracts values

            The need to convert strings to numbers arises very often. For
            example, if we are getting values from HTML form fields, they are
            usually strings. What if we want to sum them?
