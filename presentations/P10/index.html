          <h4>Usability</h4>
          <hr />
          <p class="text-start">
            Usability is a “quality attribute” that assesses how easy user
            interfaces are to use. Five main components:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Learnability</dt>
            <dd>
              how easy users can accomplish tasks the first time they encounter
              the design
            </dd>
            <dt>Efficiency</dt>
            <dd>how quickly users can perform tasks</dd>
            <dt>Memorability (retention)</dt>
            <dd>
              when users return, how easily do they re-establish proficiency
            </dd>
            <dt>Errors/safety</dt>
            <dd>
              how many errors users make, how severe, how easy to recover from
              errors
            </dd>
            <dt>Subjective satisfaction</dt>

            <li>
              Usability is one of the most important quality factors and
              acceptance criteria for web applications
            </li>
            <li>
              Unfortunately usability is analogous to human health:
              <ul>
                <li>people notice it only when it is absent</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Poorly usable web applications lead to frustration and cause users
              to reject them. This is particularly true if there are
              alternatives.
            </li>
            <li>
              The objective is to design web applications so that users can
              achieve their goals effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily.

          <ul>
            <li>Web apps have to be particularly intuitive for users</li>
            <li>
              There are five major factors that can be used to determine the
              usability of a web application:
              <ul>
                <li>The Response Time (download time for a page)</li>
                <li>The Organization System of the website</li>
                <li>The Navigation System used throughout the site</li>
                <li>The Content of the website</li>
                <li>The Aesthetics of the website</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>UF1: Response Time - Loading Time</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              All efforts in UX/UI design are wasted if website performance is
              poor.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a website takes too long to load, users will leave. How long is
              too long?
              <ul>
                <li>
                  0.1 second is about the limit for having the user feel that
                  the system is reacting instantaneously
                </li>
                <li>
                  1.0 second is about the limit for the user's flow of thought
                  to stay uninterrupted
                </li>
                <li>
                  10 seconds is about the limit for keeping the user's attention
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

              Factors that affect the loading time of a web page
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Technical/Hardware related: available network bandwidth,
                  connection speed, the location of the server and assets, the
                  CPU/GPU/memory of the device etc.

                    <li>
                      Poor coding standards - Formatting can be fixed with tools
                      like: DirtyMarkUp, HTMLFormatter, HTML-Tidy
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Cumulative web page file size - large images, heavy use of
                      CSS and JavaScript, plugins, complex queries
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                  Online tools like WebPageTest, PageSpeed Insights, or
                  GTMetrix, or PingDom can help you determine the ‘performance
                  of your website’

            <li>The way a website is organized can affect its usability</li>
            <li>
              Organization is important because a website is about information
            </li>
            <li>Organization refers to grouping of information</li>
            <li>Grouping:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                implies providing paths to information by showing relationships
              </li>
              <li>
                but the trouble with relationships is that they are subjective
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Exercise for you: organize the following information</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Refrigerator, Socks, Nightstand, Living Room, Dictionary,

              Determining how to organize your web site is no easy task.
              <ul>
                <li>need to understand information architecture</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    IA is not about the design, it is a matter of where
                    content/links should be on a site - about the structure

              An organization system refers to SCHEME and STRUCTURE:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Organization Scheme: how a site is subdivided into sections
                  (categorizing content based on the way you want each piece to
                  relate to the other). Two types:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Exact Organization Schemes</li>
                    <li>Subjective Organization Schemes</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Organization Structure: the relationships between these
                  sections
                  <ul>
                    <li>Linear, Hub, Web, etc.</li>
                  </ul>

        <section>
          <h4>Exact Organization Schemes</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Divide content into sections that are mutually exclusive.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  information is categorized in specific categories that do not
                  overlap.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Exact Organization Schemes Types:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Alphabetical schemes: utilize the alphabet for the
                  organization of content
                </li>
                <li>Chronological schemes: organize content by date</li>
                <li>Geographical schemes: organize content on place</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Exact schemes may be difficult for users to navigate.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  users may not be familiar or may not understand how the
                  information they are seeking fits into the organizational
                  model
                </li>

          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Divide information into categories that defy exact definition. Can
              be difficult to design from the start since a subjective
              organization scheme needs to get into the mind of the user to
              organize the content.
            </li>
            <li>
              Examples of Subjective Organization Schemes Types:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Topic schemes: arrange content based upon the content’s
                  subject matter. Successful when users look for a specific
                  topic and know the keywords needed to get to that information.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Task schemes: arrange content based upon the actions that
                  users will consider when looking for content. Successful when
                  the scheme accurately identifies these tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Metaphor schemes: organize content by connecting/relating it
                  to familiar concepts and ideas. Used in desktop apps interface
                  designs but not recommended for a primary website scheme.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Audience schemes: arrange content based upon the type of
                  audience to whom the content is directed. Challenges may arise
                  if the type of audience is not identified easily.
                </li>

          <h4>Designing Schemes</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Hybrid schemes are possible (not everything is black and white)
            </li>
            <li>
              Categories generally should be mutually exclusive.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  However, sometimes it is sensible to cross-list an item in
                  more than one branch of a scheme
                </li>
                <li>
                  Remember however that too much cross-listing, then scheme
                  loses its value
                </li>

          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              The structure of information defines how different categories
              defined by the scheme relate to one another.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Structure defines way users navigate through information
                </li>
                <li>It is the plan or map of the pages in a site</li>
              </ul>

          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              When a user enters a web site:
              <ul>
                <li>they usually try to find something, and</li>
                <li>they must decide whether to search or to browse</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Some users are “search-dominant”, others are “link-dominant”
            </li>
            <li>
              About 50% of users will use search rather than the navigation
              system.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  if the search facility is not very accurate, adding a ‘search’
                  may be counter-productive.

                <li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              In any case, in any page in your site, users should be able to
              tell:
              <ul>
                <li>Where on the web am I?</li>
                <li>Where in the site am I?</li>
                <li>Where can I go?</li>
                <li>Where have I been?</li>

          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              In addition to the previous, the navigation system has to be:
              <ul>
                <li>simple and clear (reduce ambiguity, intuitive)</li>
                <li>consistent among website</li>
                <li>easily accessible (e.g. sticky on top)</li>
                <li>responsive (support small devices)</li>
                <li>
                  Follow conventions ('Home'-'About'-'Contact', search box
                  should be available on every page, footer with global
                  navigation as hypertext, include sitemap, etc.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Follow the 3-clicks rule (as much as possible - no more than
                  three clicks to find something, no more than seven
                  categories.)
                </li>

              For most users, this is the page they are looking for.
              <ul>
                <li>e.g., single article, product, story, blog entry, etc.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The focus of this page should be the content, not advertising,

            </li>
            <li>
              Nothing is more important than the content of the site. Content
              should be:
              <ul>
                <li>Informative, Accurate, Timely, Readable</li>
              </ul>

            <li>Do not design your site without the content.</li>
            <li>
              Remember that users DO NOT READ on the web. They scan!
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Reading from computer screens is tiring and about 25% slower
                  than reading from paper

                  Highlighted keywords, meaningful sub-headings, bulleted lists,

          <ul>
            <li>
              Simplicity of the design
              <ul>
                <li>Do not add unnecessary design elements (KISS rule)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Consistency of the design
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Examples: navigation, layout, same color scheme, consistent
                  graphics, same font, etc.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Familiarity of the design
              <ul>
                <li>Don’t reinvent patterns - use existing ones</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              These three guidelines should be applied to all usability
              components:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Organization System, Navigation System, Content, Aesthetics

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              You should be clear of what your goals are.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Define target audience, objectives and purpose of website,

              The top section says "Here’s the top of the page". Sounds obvious,

            </li>
            <li>
              On any site, both the main branding and main navigation should be

            <li>
              In past few years, bright, strong colors were used to draw the
              eye.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, designers and brands take a step back from those vivid
              colors towards more muted color palettes
            </li>
            <li>
              Muted colors have been slightly desaturated with black, white or a
              complementary color. They are basically the opposite of vivid
              colors.

              They are commonly used at the very top of page backgrounds, where
              they help denote the boundary of the viewable area. In general,
              gradients can:
              <ul>
                <li>soften areas that would otherwise be flat color/tone.</li>
                <li>can create the illusion of a non-flat surface.</li>
                <li>
                  be used to fade a color into a lighter or darker tone, which
                  can help create mood.

              Tonal contrast is a fundamental design element:
              <ul>
                <li>It differentiates elements</li>
                <li>
                  It brings out dominant elements and mutes lesser elements
                </li>
                <li>It creates dynamism</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

              Contrast attracts your eye
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Contrast makes things stand out from their surroundings, so
                  things with higher contrast will be more noticeable

                  Designers use it to create contrast and hierarchy in the

                crawlers by misleading the search engine robots into thinking
                the content on the page is different than it really is.

                <strong>Duplicate Content:</strong> Copying content from other
                sites and posting it on yours as the ‘original’ is plagiarism
                and Google identifies it quickly.

                <strong>Google Bombing:</strong> influencing the rank of a page
