          <h4>Usability</h4>
          <hr />
          <p class="text-start">
            Usability is a “quality attribute” that assesses how easy user
            interfaces are to use. Five main components:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Learnability</dt>
            <dd>
              how easy users can accomplish tasks the first time they encounter
              the design
            </dd>
            <dt>Efficiency</dt>
            <dd>how quickly users can perform tasks</dd>
            <dt>Memorability (retention)</dt>
            <dd>
              when users return, how easily do they re-establish proficiency
            </dd>
            <dt>Errors/safety</dt>
            <dd>
              how many errors users make, how severe, how easy to recover from
              errors
            </dd>
            <dt>Subjective satisfaction</dt>

            <li>
              Usability is one of the most important quality factors and
              acceptance criteria for web applications
            </li>
            <li>
              Unfortunately usability is analogous to human health:
              <ul>
                <li>people notice it only when it is absent</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Poorly usable web applications lead to frustration and cause users
              to reject them. This is particularly true if there are
              alternatives.
            </li>
            <li>
              The objective is to design web applications so that users can
              achieve their goals effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily.

          <ul>
            <li>Web apps have to be particularly intuitive for users</li>
            <li>
              There are five major factors that can be used to determine the
              usability of a web application:
              <ul>
                <li>The Response Time (download time for a page)</li>
                <li>The Organization System of the website</li>
                <li>The Navigation System used throughout the site</li>
                <li>The Content of the website</li>
                <li>The Aesthetics of the website</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>UF1: Response Time - Loading Time</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              All efforts in UX/UI design are wasted if website performance is
              poor.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a website takes too long to load, users will leave. How long is
              too long?
              <ul>
                <li>
                  0.1 second is about the limit for having the user feel that
                  the system is reacting instantaneously
                </li>
                <li>
                  1.0 second is about the limit for the user's flow of thought
                  to stay uninterrupted
                </li>
                <li>
                  10 seconds is about the limit for keeping the user's attention
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

              Factors that affect the loading time of a web page
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Technical/Hardware related: available network bandwidth,
                  connection speed, the location of the server and assets, the
                  CPU/GPU/memory of the device etc.

                    <li>
                      Poor coding standards - Formatting can be fixed with tools
                      like: DirtyMarkUp, HTMLFormatter, HTML-Tidy
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Cumulative web page file size - large images, heavy use of
                      CSS and JavaScript, plugins, complex queries
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                  Online tools like WebPageTest, PageSpeed Insights, or
                  GTMetrix, or PingDom can help you determine the ‘performance
                  of your website’

            <li>The way a website is organized can affect its usability</li>
            <li>
              Organization is important because a website is about information
            </li>
            <li>Organization refers to grouping of information</li>
            <li>Grouping:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                implies providing paths to information by showing relationships
              </li>
              <li>
                but the trouble with relationships is that they are subjective
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Exercise for you: organize the following information</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Refrigerator, Socks, Nightstand, Living Room, Dictionary,

              Determining how to organize your web site is no easy task.
              <ul>
                <li>need to understand information architecture</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    IA is not about the design, it is a matter of where
                    content/links should be on a site - about the structure

              An organization system refers to SCHEME and STRUCTURE:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Organization Scheme: how a site is subdivided into sections
                  (categorizing content based on the way you want each piece to
                  relate to the other). Two types:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Exact Organization Schemes</li>
                    <li>Subjective Organization Schemes</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Organization Structure: the relationships between these
                  sections
                  <ul>
                    <li>Linear, Hub, Web, etc.</li>
                  </ul>

        <section>
          <h4>Exact Organization Schemes</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Divide content into sections that are mutually exclusive.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  information is categorized in specific categories that do not
                  overlap.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Exact Organization Schemes Types:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Alphabetical schemes: utilize the alphabet for the
                  organization of content
                </li>
                <li>Chronological schemes: organize content by date</li>
                <li>Geographical schemes: organize content on place</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Exact schemes may be difficult for users to navigate.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  users may not be familiar or may not understand how the
                  information they are seeking fits into the organizational
                  model
                </li>

          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Divide information into categories that defy exact definition. Can
              be difficult to design from the start since a subjective
              organization scheme needs to get into the mind of the user to
              organize the content.
            </li>
            <li>
              Examples of Subjective Organization Schemes Types:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Topic schemes: arrange content based upon the content’s
                  subject matter. Successful when users look for a specific
                  topic and know the keywords needed to get to that information.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Task schemes: arrange content based upon the actions that
                  users will consider when looking for content. Successful when
                  the scheme accurately identifies these tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Metaphor schemes: organize content by connecting/relating it
                  to familiar concepts and ideas. Used in desktop apps interface
                  designs but not recommended for a primary website scheme.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Audience schemes: arrange content based upon the type of
                  audience to whom the content is directed. Challenges may arise
                  if the type of audience is not identified easily.
                </li>

          <h4>Designing Schemes</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Hybrid schemes are possible (not everything is black and white)
            </li>
            <li>
              Categories generally should be mutually exclusive.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  However, sometimes it is sensible to cross-list an item in
                  more than one branch of a scheme
                </li>
                <li>
                  Remember however that too much cross-listing, then scheme
                  loses its value
                </li>

          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              The structure of information defines how different categories
              defined by the scheme relate to one another.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Structure defines way users navigate through information
                </li>
                <li>It is the plan or map of the pages in a site</li>
              </ul>

          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              When a user enters a web site:
              <ul>
                <li>they usually try to find something, and</li>
                <li>they must decide whether to search or to browse</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Some users are “search-dominant”, others are “link-dominant”
            </li>
            <li>
              About 50% of users will use search rather than the navigation
              system.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  if the search facility is not very accurate, adding a ‘search’
                  may be counter-productive.

            <li>
              Every web site should provide both:
              <ul>
                <li>A way to find information via a search facility</li>
                <li>
                  A way to find information via clicking on a series of links,
                  also called a Navigation System
                </li>
              </ul>

          <h4>The Navigation System</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              In any case, in any page in your site, users should be able to
              tell:
              <ul>
                <li>Where on the web am I?</li>
                <li>Where in the site am I?</li>
                <li>Where can I go?</li>
                <li>Where have I been?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Navigation System Guidelines</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              In addition to the previous, the navigation system has to be:
              <ul>
                <li>simple and clear (reduce ambiguity, intuitive)</li>
                <li>consistent among website</li>
                <li>easily accessible (e.g. sticky on top)</li>
                <li>responsive (support small devices)</li>
                <li>
                  Follow conventions ('Home'-'About'-'Contact', search box
                  should be available on every page, footer with global
                  navigation as hypertext, include sitemap, etc.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Follow the 3-clicks rule (as much as possible - no more than
                  three clicks to find something, no more than seven
                  categories.)
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>UF4: Content</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              For most users, this is the page they are looking for.
              <ul>
                <li>e.g., single article, product, story, blog entry, etc.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The focus of this page should be the content, not advertising,
              navigation, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nothing is more important than the content of the site. Content
              should be:
              <ul>
                <li>Informative, Accurate, Timely, Readable</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Do not design your site without the content.</li>
            <li>
              Remember that users DO NOT READ on the web. They scan!
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Reading from computer screens is tiring and about 25% slower
                  than reading from paper
                </li>
              </ul>

          <h4>Content Guideline</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Make the content scannable
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Highlighted keywords, meaningful sub-headings, bulleted lists,
                  anything to help the user filter what s/he is looking for
                </li>
                <li>One idea per paragraph</li>
                <li>Inverted pyramid style of writing (conclusion first)</li>
                <li>Half the word count of conventional writing</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Web Design Guidelines</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Simplicity of the design
              <ul>
                <li>Do not add unnecessary design elements (KISS rule)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Consistency of the design
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Examples: navigation, layout, same color scheme, consistent
                  graphics, same font, etc.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Familiarity of the design
              <ul>
                <li>Don’t reinvent patterns - use existing ones</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              These three guidelines should be applied to all usability
              components:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Organization System, Navigation System, Content, Aesthetics
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              You should be clear of what your goals are.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Define target audience, objectives and purpose of website,
                  content
                </li>
              </ul>

          <h4>Separate Top Sections</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              The top section says "Here’s the top of the page". Sounds obvious,
              but it feels good to know clearly where the page starts
            </li>
            <li>
              On any site, both the main branding and main navigation should be
              obvious, bold and clear.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Bold Text Introductions</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>Many sites lead with strong all-text headline descriptions.</li>
            <li>These normally set out the site's USP or main message.</li>
            <li>They tend to be graphical, rather than regular text.</li>
          </ul>
          <img class="r-stretch" src="../../assets/P10_bold.png" />
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Bold Logos</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              A clear, bold, strong brand - incorporating attitude, tone of
              voice, and first impression - is helped by a bold logo.
            </li>
            <li>
              logo should:
              <ul>
                <li>be recognizable and distinctive</li>
                <li>
                  represent your brand's personality and qualities on first
                  viewing
                </li>
